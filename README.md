 üöÄFeatures
Encryption & Decryption:
Encrypt or decrypt text messages using the classic Caesar Cipher technique.
Support for both user-defined and randomly generated shift values.
Password Protection:
Option to add password protection for encrypted messages.
Only the correct password allows successful decryption.
Strong Password Enforcement:
Passwords must meet stringent security requirements:
At least 8 characters long.
Includes uppercase and lowercase letters, a number, and a special character.
Secure Shift Generation:
Allows for random secure shift values to add an extra layer of unpredictability.
Error Handling:
Robust error handling for invalid inputs, including empty messages and incorrect passwords.
User-Friendly Interface:
Simple, intuitive text-based interface with helpful messages and warnings.
Persistent Encrypted Storage:
Stores encrypted messages alongside their respective password and shift for seamless decryption.
üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
Python: A versatile programming language perfect for implementing cryptographic algorithms.
Regular Expressions: For password validation to ensure adherence to security standards.
Random Module: For generating secure shift values.
